# Unix Timestamp Converter â€“ Chrome Extension

Adds a browser action to Chrome where you can input an unix timestamp and have it be converted to local time and GMT.

Will need to install manually for now, not available on the Chrome Web Store yet.
Clone to your computer and use the "Load unpacked extension" option on the Extensions page in Chrome
